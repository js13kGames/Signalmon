The environment has an effect on your Signalmon. You see, there are lots of bugs in the world of Signalmon that affect the mood of your friend.

**Wiflies ðŸ•·**

These insects thrive in Wifi rich environments. Whenever you are in an area with good coverage they will start to show up.

They are very annoying and constantly try to sting your friend. They will bring your Signalmon's mood down so you might want to go offline for a while. But if you capture a bunch of them, you can make them into nutricious meals and feed them to your Signalmon.

**Buzzards ðŸ¦Ž**

Curious little beings, attracted by loud noises. Whenever you are in an area with lots of music or noise, they start to show up.

These insects are also *noisy*. If a bunch of them are around, Signalmons can't sleep.
But their buzzing sound will improve the Signalmon's mood.
