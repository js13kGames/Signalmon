# signalmon

Signalmon is a tamagochi-like game.
When you first run this game, you get to meet your own Signalmon. They will live in your browser forever.

The signalmon has basic needs like

- Hunger/Food
- Energy/Sleep
- Mood/Fun

You can affect the moods of your signalmon with certain actions:

- Buy him food and water
- Buy him a mattress or comfy bed to sleep when tires
- Give him toys to play

The environment has an effect on your Signalmon. You see, there are lots of bugs in the world of Signalmon that affect the mood of your friend.

**Wiflies ü¶ü**

These insects thrive in Wifi rich environments. Whenever you are in an area with good coverage they will start to show up.

They are very annoying and constantly try to sting your friend. They will bring your Signalmon's mood down so you might want to go offline for a while. But if you capture a bunch of them, you can make them into nutricious meals and feed them to your Signalmon.

**Buzzsps üêù**

They thrive is sound-rich environments. Whenever you are in an area with lots of music or noise, they start to show up.

These insects are *noisy*. If a bunch of them are around, Signalmons can't sleep.
But if only a couple ones are around, their buzzing sound will improve the Signalmon's mood. Also, if you capture them, you can sell them and use the money to buy items like beds and toys.

**üëã Shaking the device**

If you shake the device a little bit, you can also improve your Sigmon's mood. If you shake it too hard, it will have the opposite effect and might also wake a sleeping Sigmon up.
